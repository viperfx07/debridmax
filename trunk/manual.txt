1. use the submission window ("debrider" window. so copy the links and paste it on the textbox and click GO
2. use the context menu. so block/highlight the links and then right click and choose Telecharger....
3. go to www.warez-bb.org/viewtopic.php?t=9239322, and you will see there are 2 buttons beside the links (Tous telecharges and telecharger). Tous telecharges is normally for download all the links that are hosted in one host (fileserve only or filesonic only, for instance). Because there are 2 hosts there, it will select the first one. To use telecharger, u have to select the links you want to download prior to clicking the "telecharger" button
4. lastly, if you find a megaupload, rapidshare link, you can generate that one link by clicking it, and it will be auto-generated (not tested yet).
(that should be works for all the host you support (hf,fs,etc) except for video sharing sites).


Changes needed if more hosts added:
- const.js
- content.js
- background.html
